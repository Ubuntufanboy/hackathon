## The idea 💡

The idea behind the project is to give people with fine motor disabilities the ability to acess computers using sign language instead. There is a website made with React that allows access to the sign language interpreter. 

## How was it made? 🔧

 Backend was made with python. Uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and our **home made** AI training model made from scratch.
 
 Frontend was made with React, js, and simple css. 
 
 Using fetch API to connect the two to makde a beautiful program that can be used by anybody.
